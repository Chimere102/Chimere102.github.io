Lab 4, part 2. This lab was a lab that I enjoyed because it utilized cin and cout statements alongside side if and else statements to read user input and output information to the user. It also demonstrated the importance of using if statements within a certain order and checking the conditions to see whether or not they were met. It also demonstrated how there are multiple ways that one can go about writing if statements, but that some ways are much more clear than others.

Lab 9, part 2
This was a lab that I genuinely enjoyed because this lab we used the fstream library and were able to use commands that would allow us to read files. In the file secret.cc we wrote lines of code that would help manipulate a text within a file. When entering this class this wasn't something that I thought of doing through coding and it was cool to see how it could be done. It also highlighted the importance of understanding your code as you write and how when manipulating files you can easily delete all your lines of code within a file accidentally. 

Lab 7, part 1
This was another lab that I enjoyed this semester as it utilized using if statements and operators such as "OR" and "and" to check conditions on whether or not people could park on a certain day. I think that this is an extremely useful lab as there are genuinely billions of examples of real-world conditional statements involving conditions where "or" or "and" are used for either conscious or subconscious problem-solving. This lab also involved the stoi function which is extremely useful especially when working with command line arguments as text read on the command line is interpreted as a string.
