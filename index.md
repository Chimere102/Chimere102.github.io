Lab 4, part 2. This lab was a lab that I enjoyed because it utilized using cin and cout statements alongside side if and else statements to read user input and output information to the user. It also demonstrated the importance of using if statements within a certain order and checking the conditions to see whether or not they were met. It also demonstrated how there are multiple ways that one can go about writing if statements, but that some ways are much more clear than others.
